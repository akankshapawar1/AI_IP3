1. I used code from games4e.py in TicTacToeClass.py
2. I copied few functions from utils4e.py that were used in monte carlo method.
3. All the functions are same except, I added print statements for available moves and selected moves in all player function.
4. I referred to the sample output while designing the input loop.

Thank you!
